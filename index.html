    <p id="aboutme"> 
    Hello! My name is Rachel Folse. I was born on June 15th, 2001. My favorite color is Pink. My favorite foods are Mac
    and Cheese and Pizza. For fun, I have several hobbies. I like to weightlift and do yoga up to five times a week.
    I also like to listen to music. I like all genres including pop, rap, r&b, and rock. Same with the 
    television shows I watch, I like everything from reality shows to anime. I travel every so often. Some of the places
    I've been are Washington DC, Disney World, Michigan, and North Carolina. I usually journal all these activities in my 
    planner. As far as my professional life goes, I went to Southeastern Louisiana University where I got my undergraduate degree 
    in Strategic Communications. While I was there, I worked at the Lion's Roar Newspaper where I wrote many stories,
    interviewed students through email, and took photographs using my Canon camera. After I graduated, I got a full time 
    position as a Technology Operations Associate at Wells Fargo. I also am in the Web Design and Online Communication program
    at the University of Florida. Feel free to follow my social medias!
